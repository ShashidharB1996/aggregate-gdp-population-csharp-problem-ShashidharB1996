# Aggregate GDP and Population

**Objective:** The objective is to aggregate the Population and GDP of year 2012 of G20 Countries by continent.

## Instructions for the Assignment

Write a C# program to aggregate the Population and GDP of year 2012 of G20 Countries by
Continent in `output/output.json`. Additionally you would have also have to write the test case in `AggregateGDPPopulation.Tests/AggregateGDPPopulationTest` which checks your output against your `expected-output.json`.

The `datafile.csv` is present in the data folder, which you would want to aggregate.

In order to aggregate Countries by Continent you would have to rely on any external source, but the aggregated output should be in coherence with `AggregateGDPPopulation.Tests/expected-output.json`.
